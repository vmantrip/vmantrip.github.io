This project involved forecasting future demand for a given dataset using **Exponential Smoothing with Linear and Ratio Trend Patterns**. The objective was to generate demand estimates for the next four quarters based on historical data trends.

By leveraging **Exponential Smoothing**, demand fluctuations were adjusted while incorporating trend components to account for seasonality and growth patterns. Both **linear and ratio-based trends** were analyzed to determine current demand levels and rate of change, ensuring more accurate predictions.

### Key Methodologies:
- **Exponential Smoothing Techniques** for demand forecasting  
- **Trend Analysis (Linear & Ratio)** for pattern identification  
- **Tracking Signal & Forecast Error Metrics** to assess accuracy  
- **Data Processing & Visualization** for trend interpretation  

This project highlights expertise in **inventory management, production planning, and predictive analytics**, demonstrating the ability to apply quantitative models for effective supply chain decision-making.
