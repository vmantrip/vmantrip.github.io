This project applies the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model to optimize production planning for a chemical firm manufacturing sodium bisulfate in 100-pound bags. The study determines the optimal production batch size, inventory levels, production run time, annual production runs, and potential cost savings with improved setup costs.

Using mathematical modeling and supply chain optimization techniques, key operational metrics were calculated, including:

Optimal production quantity per run using the EPQ formula.
Average inventory levels to minimize holding costs.
Production run duration based on demand and production capacity.
Annual production cycles required to meet demand.
Cost savings from reduced setup costs, enhancing efficiency and profitability.
The project demonstrates expertise in inventory management, production scheduling, and supply chain cost analysis. By leveraging quantitative analysis and optimization techniques, it showcases the ability to improve manufacturing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
